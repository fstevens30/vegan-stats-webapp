# Vegan Stats Web Application

**Turning my Python Vegan Calculator into a full HTML, CSS and JavaScript program**

## The Python version can be found [here](https://github.com/fstevens30/python_playground_2022/blob/main/vegan-stats.py).

## About

The program will feature a form where a user can input an amount of years, months and days and it will then output a result of what the user has saved during their time as a vegan. The metrics include;
- Animal lives saved :cow:
- Square metres of forest saved :deciduous_tree:
- Litres of water saved :shower:
- Kilograms of grain saved :ear_of_rice:

The data is then displayed nicely for the user to understand the impact they make, it will also give cool facts if certain parameters are met.
- Example; If the user has saved a total of over 3.41km<sup>2</sup> of forest the user will be told that they have saved an area of forest greater than Central Park.
